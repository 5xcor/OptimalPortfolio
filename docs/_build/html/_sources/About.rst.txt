I am Vivek, an engineering undergraduate at the University of Cambridge. I am
interested in the intersection of engineering, finance and AI. For more details
head over to my `blog <https://medium.com/engineer-quant>`_.

Recently I was self educating myself about quantitative portfolio optimisation
and risk management. What better way to test my understanding that to
implement it in a project. Furthermore, many of the existing python libraries
for portfolio management were inadequate. Hence, I decided to create this
robust library for portfolio optimisation.
