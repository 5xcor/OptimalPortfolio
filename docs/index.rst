PortfolioAnalytics is a robust open source library for Portfolio Optimisation
and Analytics, that implements methods of optimising security portfolios.
Classical techniques of efficient frontier are effectively implemented, along
with modern developments such as shrinkage and CVaR, with effort to improve
shrinkage methods. There is an attempt to develop novel optimisation methods
using higher moments of the distribution.
This library is easily accessible and highly developable. Optimal for both
algorithmic traders and fundamental investors to improve their returns in an
risk free way.
